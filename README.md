# AWS S3 based website with Google authorization
This project creates a template for a static website hosted on AWS S3 and secured with Google account authorisation
This solution utilizes AWS Cloudfront + AWS Lambda@Edge solution. Please find details of the technology [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-edge.html)

Picture: AWS

We also use Serverless framework to manage deployments to AWS.

**PLEASE NOTE THAT ONLY `index.html` IS CONSIDERED AS SENSITIVE CONTENT AND PROTECTED WITH LAMBDA@EDGE VALIDATION**

## Authorization rules:
Only Google users from email domain defined in main.js are allowed to browse a site secured with current solution.
Feel free to adjust to your needs

## Architecture
Following are the objects created in AWS in our approach:
- S3 bucket to host static content
- Cloudfront distribution with required configuration
- Lambda which validates authorization using Google account
- Lambda version and association of that version with Cloudfront distribution created (basically, that is notorious Lambda@Edge)
- Roles and Permissions required for Lambda and Lambda@Edge (Roles are auto generated, this can be skipped)

## System Requirements
1. Node package manager
2. NPM Serverless package
3. AWS Credentials (using aws configure, must have access to read/write/delete)

## Setup AWS account
Assuming that AWS account is already created

## Setup Google project
Since we use Google authorization mechanism
 - Google Cloud Platform project must be created in order to manage credentials
 - OAuth 2.0 client ID should be created in GCP project -> APIs & SErvices -> Credentials

## Deploy new secured site container
 - Open `serverless.yml` and replace `<static-site-bucket-name>` with the name of the bucket you would like to create and use as static website
 - Open `main.js` and replace `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` string with Client ID of oauth client configured for your GCP project
 - Run `npm install` assuming that you have `npm` installed on your machine
 - Run `sls deploy` assuming that you have `serverless` installed on your machine
 Usually it takes 15-20 minutes for AWS Cloudfront to copy files to edge locations

## Upload static site content
 - Open `html_templates/main.html` and replace `clientId` value with oauth client id
 - Prepare your static site files with `index.html` as an entry point
 - Load `main.html`, `index.html` and all other required files into AWS S3 bucket defined in `serverless.yml`
Further, `serverless-finch` plugin could be used to automate copying site contents to S3

## Restrict public access to index.html
Navigate to AWS Cloudfront origin create after `sls deploy` completion.
Then edit the origin object and set following parameters:
 - Restrict Bucket Access -> Yes
 - Origin Access Identity -> Use an Existing Identity
 - Your Idetities -> *Choose an existing one. If not exists, choose Create a new one in Origin Access Identity parameter*
 - Grant Read Permissions on Bucket -> Yes, Update Bucket Policy
After the permissions are set, verify that you can access your site via Cloudfront and can't via S3 static site link

## Authenticate mutlple pages
To secure multiple pages using google authentication, go to Cloudfront distribution -> Edit settings
- Open tab "Behaviour"
- Edit index.html behaviour to *.html
- Add new behaviour main.html with similar settings as index.html except for lambda redirect.

## Defining alternative CNAME
If you want to attach a custom domain name to your Cloudfront distribution, you need to:
 - Create a CNAME for your domain name in AWS Route53 or in another domain names provider of your choice
 - Navigate to a Cloudfront distribution and add a CNAME created to a `Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)` list
